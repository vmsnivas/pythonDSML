In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph 123
This distinction allows word wrap to automatical4ly re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks.
The software may apply vertic3al white space or indenting at paragraph 4 breaks, depending on the selected style. 
How such documents are actually stored depends on the file format. 
For example, HTML uses the <p> tag as a paragraph container. 
In plaintext files, there are two common formats. 
The pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. 
An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.
A line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in prose. 
HTML's <br /> tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each "paragraph" is a stanza), or in a street address.[5]
